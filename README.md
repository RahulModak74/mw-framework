# Modak-Walawalkar (M-W) Framework
## Physics-Constrained Geometric Learning for Computational Physics - THINK MANIFOLDS


We want to help people migrate from traditional thinking which is in terms of PDEs, identify domain - define and solve complex PDEs for hours- create risk measures for the domain - silo approach.

To Bayesian Manifold Approach

Define problem -- understand literature -- define priors -- create/ get sample data -- train manifold (e.g. with pyro-pytorch) --- distance from manifold what we call MW distance is universal risk measure--- achieve 1000-1000,000 X speed ups on GPU!

## 🎯 What This Is

The M-W Framework demonstrates that **any physical conservation law can be encoded as geometric structure in a variational autoencoder's latent space**. Through automatic differentiation and pullback metrics, the framework automatically satisfies physics constraints without explicit PDE solving or spatial discretization.

**Key Innovation:** Physics constraints → Bayesian priors → Learned geometry → Automatic computation

## 🚀 Quick Start: Gravitational Wave Templates

### Installation
```bash
pip3 install torch numpy pyro-ppl scipy
git clone https://github.com/RahulModak74/mw-framework.git
cd mw-framework
```

### Step 1: Generate Kerr Geodesic Data
```bash
python3 kerr_1_generate_data.py --samples 10000 --seed 42
```
**Output:** `kerr_geodesics.npy` (10,000 geodesic points from Kerr spacetime)

### Step 2: Train VAE & Verify Geometry
```bash
python3 kerr_2_train_and_test_pyro.py --data kerr_geodesics.npy
```
**Expected results:**

### Step 3: Generate Gravitational Wave Templates
```bash
python3 batch_generate_original.py --model kerr_vae.pth --n-templates 10
```
**Expected results:**
- ✅ Waveform match with Post-Newtonian: **98.5% (h₊), 99.4% (h×)**
- ✅ Generation speed: **171 templates/minute** on single GPU
- ✅ Speedup vs Numerical Relativity: **6.9 million ×**
- **Output:** Template library in `gw_lego_1000_validated/`

**Total runtime: ~15 minutes on modern laptop**

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Validation Status

### Gravitational Wave Amplitude Calibration

**Current Issue:** The raw gravitational wave amplitude from the learned geometry requires post-hoc calibration:

```
Auto-calibrated amplitude:
  Raw output:    1.222e-08
  Target (PN):   1.321e-04
  Scaling factor: 1.082e+04 (10,804×)
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ **Waveform phase/frequency:** Accurately captured by learned geometry
- ✅ **Cross-polarization ratio:** Correct (h₊ vs h× relative amplitudes)
- ⚠️ **Absolute amplitude:** Requires empirical calibration factor

**Why this happens:**
1. Training data uses approximate geodesics (not exact solutions)
2. Van Vleck determinant normalization needs refinement
3. Quadrupole formula implementation may have unit conversion issues

**Validation roadmap:**

| Phase | Task | Timeline | Status |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **Phase 1** | Schwarzschild validation (exact analytical comparison) | 2026 | 🔄 In progress |
| **Phase 2** | Exact Kerr geodesic generation (Carter equations) | TBD | 📋 Planned |
| **Phase 3** | SXS waveform comparison (no rescaling) | TBD | 📋 Planned |
| **Phase 4** | Numerical Relativity code comparison | TBD | 📋 Planned |

**How to help:** If you have expertise in:
- Exact geodesic integration (Carter equations)
- Numerical relativity validation
- Post-Newtonian theory

Please open an issue or contact us!

### What Works Reliably (Production-Ready)

✅ **Battery Analytics (32D):** No calibration needed, MAE = 0.008, deployed commercially

✅ **Cybersecurity (57D):** No calibration needed, AUC = 0.89, enterprise validated

✅ **Geometric Learning:** VAE latent space consistently learns correct metric signature across all domains

### What Needs More Validation

⚠️ **Gravitational Waves:** Phase/frequency excellent, amplitude needs work

⚠️ **Absolute Physical Units:** Conversion between geometric and SI units requires attention

## 🔬 How It Works

### Traditional Approach
```
Physics → PDEs → Discretization → Solve → Observables
├─ Requires: Tensor calculus expertise
├─ Cost: Supercomputer months
└─ Scalability: Poor (grid-based)
```

### M-W Framework
```
Physics Constraints (Priors) → VAE Learning → Geometry → Observables
├─ Requires: PyTorch + domain knowledge
├─ Cost: GPU minutes
└─ Scalability: Excellent (arbitrary dimensions)
```

### Mathematical Foundation
```python
# Pullback metric from learned decoder
g_ij(z) = J^T · W · J

# Where:
# J = Jacobian of decoder φ: z → x
# W = Physics weight matrix (encodes signature)
# g = Learned Riemannian/Lorentzian metric

# All geometric quantities via autodiff:
# - Christoffel symbols: Γ^k_ij
# - Riemann curvature: R^l_ijk
# - Van Vleck determinant: Δ(A,B)
# - World function: Ω(A,B)
```
